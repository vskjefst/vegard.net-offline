<p>2021-08-21: www.vegard.net is offline due to hardware failure. I'm not sure if and when it'll eventually be back online.</p>
  <p>UPDATE @ 20:38 CET: vbox4 is dead. It started to log CPU errors this morning, and locked up a couple of times before it went belly up for the last time. The CPU is integrated, I've tried to track down an identical replacement motherboard, but that turned out to be a dead end.</p>
  <p>Instead of spending time and money on building a new vbox, I've tracked down a second hand Raspberry Pi 4B 4GB that is more than enough to host the site. A VPS might have been an option, too, but I enjoy hosting everything myself.</p>
  <p>Expect a couple of weeks downtime. The Pi has to arrive, and I have to restore everything from backups. In the meantime, you can browse what once with the help of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210804214723/https://www.vegard.net/">Internet Acrhive mirror</a> I've been maintaining.</p>
